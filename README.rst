===========================
Raspberry Pi Smart-ish Door
===========================

.. WARNING::

  2014/05/13: this project is brand-spanking new, so it is most
  **definitely** not ready for use. Come back in a month or so.

.. IMPORTANT::

  IN CASE YOU MISSED THE "WARNING", THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY
  "PRE-ALPHA", WHICH MEANS IT DOES NOT WORK YET.

The `raspi-door` project comprises the GUI that is run on the
Raspberry PI on the inside of the door so that you can control your
door with *awesomeness*... or, as close as I can get it there.

But first you need to setup the hardware.
