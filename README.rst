.. WARNING::

  2014/09/24: this project is not fully functional yet -- come back in
  a month or so.

.. IMPORTANT::

  IN CASE YOU MISSED THE "WARNING", THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY
  "PRE-ALPHA", WHICH MEANS IT DOES NOT WORK YET.

The `raspi-door` project comprises the GUI that is run on the
Raspberry PI on the inside of the door so that you can control your
door with *awesomeness*... or, as close as I can get it there.

* Current weather display


Upcoming Features
-----------------

* Door-event calendar integration
* Subway service alerts & ETAs


Potential Features
------------------

* Exterior camera with infrared lighting
* Biometrics: face/voice/fingerprint/etc recognition

* Remote door lock/unlock with camera feed
* Nefarious activity detector! YA MAN!


Raspi-Door Hardware
===================

TODO.


Raspi-Door Software
===================

.. code-block:: bash

  # (all commands as root *or* preceded with "sudo " *or* you
  #  know what you are doing... :-)

  # (optional) create a virtualenv for raspi-door
  $ virtualenv --prompt '(raspi-door) ' /path/to/virtualenv
  $ . /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate

  # install pre-requisites that have problems with pip...
  # TODO: figure out why this is necessary...
  $ easy_install pygame==1.9.1release pgu==0.18

  $ pip install raspi-door

  # configure raspi-door
  $ raspi-door --initialize > /etc/raspi-door.conf
  $ nano /etc/raspi-door.conf
    # review all of the configuration options... and open a
    # raspi-door issue if anything is "unclear" :-)


Troubleshooting
===============

* ``"ImportError: No module named pkg_resources"``

  If you run into an issue during the install process and pip just
  doesn't work anymore, you may need to re-install
  setuptools. However, you need to do this without using `pip` or
  `easy_install`... so, check https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
  for direct installation details, i.e.:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python
